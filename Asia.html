            <h2>About Bangladesh</h2>
            <p>Bangladesh is located South Asia, with India and Myanmar as neighbors. The country was part of India when it was colonized by the british Empire, and then became East Pakistan in the 40s.
                The country gained complete independence in 1971. Bangladesh does express their concern for global issues, but choose not greatly involve themsleves in major politics. As a result, they 
                typically stay neutral in politics, meaning they do not align with the East or West. One situtation Bangladesh does get more involved in is the Rohingya crisis, as many people Rohingya people
                forced to flee Myanmar and into Bangladesh for safety. India has gotten involved to help Bangladesh ensure safety on the border between Bangladesh and Myanmar. Although Bangladesh stays neutral,
                they are a good friend to the world, and communicates mostly with India, who aids Bangladesh in times of need. Myanmar has been Bangladesh biggest threat due to the Rohingya crisis and violence
                near the border betwene the two nations.

            <h2>About Cambodia</h2>
            <p>Cambodia is a Southeast Asian country, with Thailand, Vietnam and Laos as neighbors. Duirng the Communism era, Cambodia went through immense amounts of government corruption, instability
                and genocide, as a result of the fierce Communist regime that overthrew the government. The country still has some stains from the regime and the Vietnam war, but has settled overall. 
                As of now, they are slowly recovering and improving as a nation. Cambodia has neutrally friendly relations with the West, but their political stands overall leans more the East. The nation's government status
                is an Authoritarian Regime, and their elections have a popular political party with a Marxist-Leninst ideology. It is plausible that China is Cambodia's best ally, given that the Cambodia has some Chinese influence,
                and has given Cambodia their support as the nation develops. Relations between Vietnam and Cambodia have been historically tense due to immigration issues and territorial disputes. However, this relationship has been
                remarkably improving. Apart from that, Cambodia has not outstanding enemies or international threats. </p>

            <h2>About China</h2>
            <p>China is one of the biggest, strongest, most influential countries in the world. China is a leading Eastern power, maintaining a communist government regime that some have classified as untouchable.
               in the early 20th Century, this country was known as the Republic of China, which aimed to maintain a democratic govenrment. After the Russian Revolution, which led to the existance of the Soviet Union,
               people in China were starting to grow dissatified with the ruling party in China, and the Soviet Union influenced the Marxist-Leninist ideology onto them. That led to the creation of the Chinese Communist
               Party in 1921. Over time, the Soviet Union gave more and more influential support to the CCP, helping them win the Chinese Civil War, and take over the government in 1949. From there, the CCP was able to spread
               Communist influence to other countries around them. Today, China is still one of the few countries, who identify as Communist. With successful influence, China is now a key ally and partner to many countries across the world.
               Russia and China are known to have one of the strongest relations in the world. China and Pakistan also have a well-known relationship, as the two nations have many economic partnerships. It is important to recognize that many countries
               in Africa have recently expressed desire to work with China, such as Egypt, Angola, Ethiopia and almost all of West Africa. Although China has many allies, tensions have also been created. The U.S and the Western powers have seen China as a threat,
               and have faced multiple economic disagreements with China. As a result of China's interference in the himalayas, India has cut imports with China as well. In the U.N, China advocates for economic development and peace in the world. (What ever gets the West
               of their back.)

            <h2>About Russian Federation</h2>
            <p>Russian Federation (Russia) is the largest country in the world, as well as one of the strongest and most influential. Given that this country used to be the Soviet Union itself,
                it is the mother country to 15 former-soviet republics who are all now soverign nations. However, Russia does not just get its influential power from territorial invasions and military presence in the Cold War.
                The country is one of the largest producers of natural gas and crude oil, resources that many nations such as Turkiye rely on to maintain their own economies. Another factor that feeds influential power is the Wagner Group,
                a private group from Russia intended to stealthily influence other nation's to become pro-Russia. With this group, Russia has caused multiple nations in Africa, such as Burkina Faso, to undergo a coup d'etat against their previously
                democratic governments. Russia is a founding member of the United Nations and a permanent member of the Security Council. In the U.N, Russia advocates for national sovereignty for other nations, meaning they do not often favor foreign interference.
                They also do not support sanctions on other nations. In terms of relations, Russia and China are known to have one of the strongest ties in the world. Belarus, a former soviet-republic, is Russia's #1 political supporter. As a result of Russia's 
                open support to other Authoritarian Regime around the world, they have great relations with Syria and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Russia has also been growing its friendship with India, as the two countries have historically had active business togther. 
                Of course, being a global power, Russia does also have tense relations with other nations. This especially includes most members of the European Union and NATO, but also allies of those groups. The most known enemies and threats to Russia are the U.S and Ukraine.
