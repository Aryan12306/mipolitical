            <h2>About Brazil</h2>
            <p>Brazil is the largest country in South America, and 5th largest in the world. They have especially strong ties with the West, as they are mostly a democracy, 
                but may have an independent position from the West. This country is significant to U.N, not just because they are one of the strongest, most powerful nations, but 
                also because they are one of the founders of the U.N itself. Brazil will almost always express concern on global issues, and is very passionate about helping the world 
                address them. They are not afraid to share their voice. Brazil is a very friendly country, with great relations all over the world. Brazil has fantastic relations with India,
                Germany, and Japan, as all 4 countries make up the G4, a group where all countries will a support one another to have permanent seats in the U.N Security Council.
                China and Brazil also have great relations, given then China is Brazil's biggest trading partner. Both countries are also in the BRICS economic alliance, which is also why Brazil
                has friendly relations with Russia, and South Africa. Brazil does not exactly have any outstanding enemies but has strained relations with Venezuela because of political differences,
                As of recently, Brazil seems to have changed its diplomatic status with Israel, as the Brazilian government outwardly criticized the Israeli government's actions in the Gaza Strip.
                Generally, however, Brazil smiles to the rest of the world.
