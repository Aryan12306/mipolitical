            <h2>About Canada</h2>
            <p>Canada is largest country in North America and the 2nd largest in the world. This country overall stays pretty relevant in discussing global issues in the U.N, as they have a great amount of racial diversity.
                Canada is one of the most democratic countries in the world. Their political stance definitely leans more towards the West. They are not just one of the founders of NATO, but the United Nations itself. 
                Canada is a very strong friend and ally to the other nations who are part of the Western alliance. The United States and Canada have one of the best relations in the world, as they have many treaties, deals
                policies, and partnerships between them. The country also has a good connection with the United Kingdom and France. That being said, Canada does favor peaceful approaches to global situations. In other words, they are not afraid
                to abstain on Western-suggested efforts in the U.N, and their Western allies respect that. Outside of the West, Canada has stellar relations with India. The two countries often economically work together, and it is plausible
                to say that India is Canada's best asian ally. Canada does not exactly have any outstanding enemies, but has taken Russia as a threat. However, in the U.N, Canada does not find it beneficial to engage with the West's opposition.
                As a result, they will abstain to the East as well, but will communicate with the U.S about it.

            <h2>About Guatemala</h2>
            <p>Guatemala is a country in the Central-America region of North America, bordering Belize, Mexico, El Salvador, and Honduras. 
                This country's politics have faced some back-and-conflict between Western influence and corruption, so they have evened out
                to be a Hybrid Regime. This country has been looked at as suffering from "democratic backsliding", but has closer allies in the West,
                than they do in the East. Guatemala tends to communicate locally and does not often get fully involved with the big political powers.
                As a result, the country finds itself to be neutral on most global issues. The country mostly works with Mexico and Honduras, who also like
                to stand neutral.</p>

            <h2>About Mexico</h2>
            <p>Mexico is one of the major countries in North America, and seems to be almost a leader in the Central American region. The country is a neighbor to the USA,
                Guatemala, and Belize. Mexico's poltical status has been going through back-and-forth conflict between a democracy and autocacy, so they even out to stand 
                as a Hybrid Regime. As a result of beneficial ecomomic business with other countries, Mexico's diplomacy is slightly more unqiue than that of other countries
                in Central America. Russia and Mexico have maintain very friendly relationships as Mexico chose to not join the West in any Russian cencorship. Although Mexico
                did condemn Russia for previous actions, they were still open for business with Russia. By far, the United States has been Mexico's greatest ally. The relationship
                between these two countries have been growing, as they are one of eachothers' most active traders. Additionally, Mexico has great relations with Spain due to 
                cultural similaries, and political history. With Mexico's big mix of diplomacy and political status, they stand typically stand neutral in most situations,
                but will express their concern and have a bit more interest to work with the West than the East. </p>

            <h2>About Nicaragua</h2>
            <p>Nicaragua is country located in the Central-American region of North America. Nicaragua has a unique stance and status compared to that of other countries in Central America.
                In the peak of the Cold War, Marxism-Leninism was hevaily influenced into the country's politics, which led a Sandimismo (Communisty) party to take control of the government.
                The country was led by a Communist regime until the end of the Cold War. As of now, Nicaragua is not officially Communist anymore. However. The country is still ruled by an Authoritarian
                regime with Communist-ideals. Due to this, Nicaragua politically leans well to the East and opposes the West. The country has good connections with Venezuela and Cuba, as they have close proximity
                to Nicaragua and have similar political history. Since the Soviet Union gave their diplomatic and economic support to the Sandinismo-support party that overthrew the government, Nicaragua has great ties
                with Russia. Additionally, Nicaragua follows the One-China policy and opposes the West, which strengthens their relations with China and Iran. The United States is Nicaragua's biggest enemy, as the U.S is 
                in opposition with Nicaragua's political status, and attempted to stop the Regime from taking over. Nicaragua also has territorial conflicts with Colombia and Costa Rica.
