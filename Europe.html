                Considering that the country is member of the NATO and the European Union, Albania overall has a  Western democratic stance on their politics, but is flexible to abstain
                on certain situations in the World. When it comes to international allies, Albania is very friendly with Greece and Türkiye, as well as the U.S. However, the country does
                have a current but historical conflict with Serbia, as both countries fight for influence and control over Kosovo.

                Russia, Armenia still has friendly relationships with the West. This country has been going through some political conflicts. Turkiye and Armenia have a tense relationship due to history involving actions of
                the Ottoman Empire against Armenia during World War I. Additionally, Armenia is currently undergoing territorial disputes with their neighbor to the East, Azerbaijan. Armenia's relations with these two countries

                Azerbaijan's government leans well into an Authoritarian regime, more than a democracy, which leads the country's politics to favor the East more easily. Azerbaijan used to be a communist republic that belonged 
                to the Soviet Union, but they now have healthy relations with Russia. Azerbaijan's are also guided by Muslim-brotherhood, meaning the country is an ally of most other countries that are also pro-dominantly Muslim. 
                This includes Pakistan, Iran, but especially Turkiye. Azerbaijan and Turkiye are known to have one of the strongest relations in the world, as they are very similar countries in terms of culture and political stance.
                They're similar political stance also includes their respective relations with Armenia. Azerbaijan and Armenia have been going through very tense territorial disputes for many years. As a result, Azerbaijan does not
                get along with Armenia. Although Azerbaijan have good relations with the East, it is very important to note that they do not turn their back on the West. The country has military alliances with some countries in NATO,
                but also Ukraine. At the end of the day, Azerbaijan is coorperative with both sides of the world, but will often align with Turkiye.</p>

                Although the country is an independent nation, Belarus has recieved massive Russian influence since independence. This has had an impact on this country's elections, political stances, and economic ties.
                Belarus is known to be Russias best ally, as the country almost entirely relies on Russian presence to sustain. As Russia and Belarus share some of the same allies, they also share someo of them same enemies.
                For example, Belarus conflicts with Poland due to some big political differences. Furthermore, Belrus and Ukraine poltically do not get along either, as Belarus has been helping Russia invade Ukraine by providing
                another angle for Russia come through Ukraine. It is safe to say that Belarus's poltical stance on global issues will typically align with Russia's. </p>

            <p> Bosnia & Herzegovina is a country in the Balkan region of Europe. The country used to be part of the communist Yugoslavia. Now, Bosnia is a Hybrid Regime, 
                meaning the government has both some democratic and autocratic policies. This country has a very unique government structure, containing presidencies from
                three different groups, because of the history and divsersity in the country. They have a Bosniak, Croat, and Serb presidency. Bosnia is not yet a member of
                the EU or a partner of NATO, but is a strong-standing ally of NATO. However, with the big differences in groups that Bosnia has, the country's politics have
                become pretty divided, so they often balance out to be neutral. Bosnia has influences from both the East and the West, as many Eastern-side countries have aided
                Bosnia in the past, and the country is in an ally of NATO. Muslim-brotherhood has guided Bosnia to create many friendships with some Eastern countries as well.
                As a result of all these factors, Bosnia remains as a neutral friend to all.

            <h2>About Bulgaria</h2>
            <p>Bulgaria is an Eastern European country with close proximity to Romania, Greece, and Turkiye. There is something relatively special about this country, as it has bits of influence from both the East and West.
                Bulgaria is a former-soviet republic and their civilization and culture has lots of Russian influence. However, since Bulgaria is a member of the European Union and the NATO, and as their leading parties are pro-EU, 
                the country's politics as a Flawed Democracy slightly favor the West. Bulgaria has closer relations to countries of the West than the East, but they do not turn their backs to the East either. This country's is close 
                allies with Greece and Romania, but is also very friendly to countries of the Balkan region, such as Serbia. At the same time, Bulgaria overall act neutral and occasionally friendly with Russia. Generally, Bulgaria is a friend to all,
                and is not against working with any other countries. That being said, it is reasonable to say that they would love to work with their allies in the West a bit more.</p>

                Considering that it is a Flawed Democracy and is a member of both the European Union and the NATO, Croatia's politics align well with the West. As a result, Croatia's key allies are countries
                in the EU, such as Greece. Similarly, Croatia is a great military ally with the U.S, as they are both in the NATO. Croatia looks to have no enemies in the world. However, as they are proud 
                members of the European Union, they don't communicate with Russia since Russia looks at the EU as unfriendly.</p>

                Due to this, Northern Cyprus lives a bit more independently with the rest of Cyprus. Overall, the country mostly has Greek influence, while Northern Cyprus connects more with
                Turkiye. This conflict of influence makes Cyprus political stance very complex. At the end of the day, the country will side with the West on many occassions. That being said,
                there may be some cases where Cyprus will stand as neutral. It would depend on Greece and Turkiye's position on that situation at hand. </p>

                a cultural and political alliance between the countries. Czech Republic will mostly side with the West on most global issues, but it would not be entirely suprising if Czechia stood neutral for

            <p>Finland is a country in the Nordic region of Europe, neighboring with Norway, Sweden, Russia and near Estonia. Finland was once part of Russia until 1917. In the 40s-70s, the Soviet Union attempted to occupy Finland by heavily influencing communism onto the country, 
                which was easy for Soviet Union to do considering it was Finland's largest border. Although communism was very present in Finland at one point, it was never able to take control of the government, and the nation was able to resist. Finland later joined the European Union, but declared a state oof neutrality
                for many years, up until they joined the NATO in 2023. Joining NATO broke Finlands neutrality and led its political stance to stand with West, as it does now. Finland's closest ally has been Sweden for a long time, as these two neighboring countries have secrity and defense policies
                between eachother. Finland is very friendly with the West. As far as their relations with the East go, the country separates themselves from Russia when they get the chance.

            <p>France is a country in Western Europe with close proximity to many other countries such as the United Kingdom, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, etc.. France is one of the strongest, most influential countries in the world, as they have one of the most powerful militaries, a permanent member of the UN
                Security Council, and one of the founding members of the European Union, NATO and United Nations itself. It is abundantly clear that France is a political leader in the Western alliance, and many other countries across the world. France is especially influential to many nations in West Africa, mostly due to
                former colonization, but also from economic trade. Some of France's many friends in Africa include Burkina Faso, Niger, Mali, Senegal, and Gabon. However, some of France's presence in the region has been strained as a result of coup d'etat overthrowing some democratically elected powers in West African countries. 
                Still, France looks to aid to their African allies when possible. Although the country has politically made up with many former french colonies in Africa, they could not do so with all them, as relations between Algeria and France have historically been very tense. At the moment, though, France's biggest political
                enemy seems to be Russia, since the two countries have been constantly conflicting over global influence.

            <h2>About Ireland</h2>
            <p>Ireland is Western European country bordering the United Kingdom. This country is a member of the European Union and NATO. They are one of the most democratic countries in the world, and their politics
                typically align with the West, but may take a different stance from their allies. In the U.N, Ireland takes gender equality, human rights, and development aid very seriously, perhaps more than some of the other Western allies. 
                It can be seen that Ireland is able to have a more ethical foreign policy. They will not go as far as "betray" their Western allies but will kindly communicate with them if they have a different stance. The first country they would 
                collaborate with is the United States, one of their best allies. the USA and Ireland have very strong historic ties from economics to politics. It is also important to note that Ireland is very friendly with the European Union and often works
                with members of the organization too. Ireland does not have lots of outstanding enemies but has gained lots of diplomatic tension with Israel, as Ireland passionately condemned the government's actions in the West Bank (Palestine).  </p>

                France, and the United States. Italy's diplomatic tensions mostly lie with Libya, as a result of history related to the Italian Empire, but also situations of migration across the Mediterranean. The topic of migration is whwre Italy tends to disagree with

            <h2>About Poland</h2>
            <p>Poland is a slavic country located in the Central-Eastern area of Europe, bordering many other countries, such as Germany, Ukraine, and Belarus.
                This country is known to have a great, diverse history, as this country has a big mix of Eastern and Western influence. Most recently, Poland has very heavy presence
                and influence from the Soviet Union, as it was a satellite state to them. In 1991, Poland held their first parliamentary elections and was able to officially transition 
                from Communist-ruled republic to a Western-like democracy. At the moment, Poland is mostly a democracy, and one of the most powerful countries in Europe. They are also
                a member of the European Union and NATO. On the basis of politics, Poland strongly stands with the West, and has very close ties with other nations in the military alliance.
                This especially includes their fellow nations in the Visegrád Group: Hungary, Slovakia, and Czechia. In this organization, the 4 countries share cultural values, and discuss 
                economic development and defense together. Poland and Germany have developed a very friendly relationship over the years, discussing poltics with one another. It is also important
                to recognize that Poland has stellar relations with the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), helping them defend themselves from any threats on the Russian border. 
                While Poland is generally very friendly with the World, they have strained relations with Russia due to historical conflicts. Poland also has tense diplomacy with Belarus, as Poland
                has openly criticized the Belarusian government for human-rights abuses.

            <p>United Kingdom, consisting of England, Wales, Scotland, and Norther-Ireland, is one of the most powerful, influential countres in the world and is considered a leader of the Western powers. They are a founding member of
                the of the NATO, and the United Nations itself. Additionally, they are one of the permanent members of the U.N Security Council. The United Kingdom is no longer part of the European Union,
                as a result of Brexit, but still hold strong ties with the organization's members. The British Empire, the largest empire in history granted the UK great influence almost everywhere around the world,
                including North America, the Middle East, Central and Southern Africa, South Asia, and Oceania. In the U.N, the United Kingdom is very open to aid other countries through times of need, they believe it is very important
                to condemn groups who are responsible for situations, such as private militias, or another country's government. A lack of condemnation in a U.N resolution would not typically lead the UK to veto the paper, but, perhaps, abstain and propose
                amendmentsto it. The United Kindom is a key ally to most nations in Europe and North America, especially the United States. The UK and the USA have one of the world's strongest alliances, as they work together on most issues in the U.N. France is
                also a primary military ally, and is normally included in the two nations' work. The United Kingdom additionally has important partners outside of the Europe and North America. In Africa, Nigeria and South Africa have strong diplomatic ties with the UK.
                As for Asia, India has become one of the primary allies to the UK. These two countries often collaborte on both economic and politcal matters. Given that the UK is a leading Western power, the nation does not have the most friendly relations with major powers in the East,
                including Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran. Argentina and the UK are also known to have a relatively poor relationshiop due to terrorial disputes over the Falkland Islands.</p>
