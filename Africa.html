            <h2>About Egypt</h2>
            <p>Egypt is a North African country located around the Sinai Penninsula. Egypt is the most powerful and influential country in Africa.
                Although the country is an Authoritarian Regime, as if it aligns more to the East, Egypt seems to stand very neutral, as they have strong ties
                on both the East and West side. They recieve economic development aid and military relations with many different countries from across the world, 
                especially from the United States, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, France, and the rest of the European Union. Egypt also has
                good ties with Jordan, since the two countries have very similar positions on the conflict in Israel-Palestine. Egypt has had complex relations with Israel due to historical
                and recent conflicts near the Egyptian border. However, Egypt's diplomatic tensions mostly lie with Ethiopia over economic matters.</p>
