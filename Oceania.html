            <h2>About Australia</h2>
            <p>Australia is the largest country in Oceania and 6th largest in the world. This country is also among one of the strongest, and diplomatically friendly of the world.
                Australia has lots of history related back to the Europe, as they were a siginificant British colony. Now, they are one of the most democratic countries, and closest allies to the Western powers outside
                of the Atlantic. In the U.N, Australia passionately advocates for human rights, humanitarian assistance and diplomacy. As Australia is home to many Asisn minorities and indigenous groups from the Pacific, the
                human rights and assistance to suffering group is the nation's top priority in the U.N. At the same time, they stand with their Western allies to additionally make sure aggressors are condemned in a situation (if there is an aggressor). 
                A lack of condemnation may lead Australia to hesitate. However, they will communicate with their key allies, who are the United States, United Kingdom, New Zealand and members of the EU. Again, since Australia is considered one of the most diplomatically friendly nations, 
                they do not have any outstanding tensions with others. That being said, their relationship with China could change as time goes on.
